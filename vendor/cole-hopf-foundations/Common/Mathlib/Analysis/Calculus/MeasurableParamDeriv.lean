# Measurability of a derivative in a parameter

`measurable_deriv_param`: if `v ↦ Φ v x` is differentiable at `v₀` for every parameter `x` with
derivative `D x`, and each `Φ v` is measurable in `x`, then `D` is measurable. The derivative is
the pointwise limit of the measurable difference quotients along `v₀ + 1/(n+1)`, so no joint
measurability, continuity or domination is needed. (Mathlib's `measurable_deriv` is the
measurability of `deriv f` in the *differentiation* variable, a different statement.)
