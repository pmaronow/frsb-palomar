/-! # Finite atomic approximation preserving a prescribed finite set

A grid index and the comparisons with every prescribed point form a finite
measurable partition. Choosing one point from each nonempty partition cell
gives an actual finite-range map. Points in the same cell have distance at
most one grid mesh, and their left-cut and singleton membership agree at
every prescribed point. This construction does not move nearby mass onto
one of the prescribed atoms.
